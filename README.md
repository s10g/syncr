# syncr
Self-contained bash script and configuration to set up rsyncing between two locations

## Howto
Edit the script to set remote host, remote path and other things. Save script in the folder you want to sync; it will sync any folder beyond that (unless excluded from synchronising).

Run like this:
```
sh syncr upload|download|delete
```
